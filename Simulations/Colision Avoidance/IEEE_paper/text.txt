The proposed collision avoidance algorithm is based on continuous modification of the robot’s motion vector resulting from the combined influence of the navigation goal and obstacles present in the environment. The entire solution was implemented and evaluated in the Webots simulation environment, which enabled controlled reproduction of navigation scenarios and detailed analysis of the resulting trajectories. The algorithm is structured as a deterministic finite-state machine composed of five states, responsible for goal-oriented motion, obstacle detection, avoidance maneuver execution, rejoining the nominal path toward the target, and post-avoidance motion stabilization. Transitions between states are triggered by real-time distance measurements to obstacles and by the geometric relationship between the robot and the target. At each control iteration, a resultant steering vector is computed as a combination of an attractive component directing the robot toward the target and a repulsive component generated by obstacles, whose influence increases as the robot approaches their boundaries. In the presence of large-scale obstacles, such as the brick wall considered in test_2, the algorithm produces a characteristic smooth curvature of the trajectory, allowing the robot to safely bypass the obstacle while maintaining consistent convergence toward the goal. This approach eliminates the need for global path planning, ensures motion continuity, and reduces abrupt heading changes, which is particularly important for mobile robots operating in constrained or dynamic environments.
